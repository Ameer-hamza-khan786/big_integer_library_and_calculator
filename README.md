### BigInt Calculator

Developed a C++ program that handles arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large integers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.
The program also evaluates mathematical expressions provided in infix notation by converting them to postfix notation and then evaluating the postfix expression.

**Technologies Used:** C++, STL (Standard Template Library), Console I/O, Algorithm Design

**Role:** Developer

**Key Achievements:**
- Designed and implemented the `BigInt` class to handle large integer arithmetic, supporting operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.
- Developed operator overloading for custom operations on the `BigInt` class, improving the ease of use and readability of the code.
- Created a robust algorithm for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, including infix to postfix conversion using a stack-based approach.
- Implemented error handling mechanisms to manage invalid inputs and edge cases, ensuring the program's reliability.
- Developed an interactive console-based user interface for evaluating arithmetic expressions and performing two-number calculations.
